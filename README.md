# JamesXRomeo, assignment for Erasys

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Hello and welcome to my assesment for one of the coolest companies out there! This was a labour of love, For this app i chose to work with React, Styled Componants a lot of Hooks and a fair amount of Props. This is my MVP I wanted to create a sleek app that could fetch and display data from a given api (or two) 

This app has a search bar which allows you to search for users by name. more features such as a sort by distance or activity function aswell as filters based on Picture presence usw will be on the way shortly. 

This was my first run using styled componants, and I'mnot overly sure If I got the best practices right. DEspite this I felt it important to show that given a small amount of time i can deliver something special

Thank you for checking this out!
